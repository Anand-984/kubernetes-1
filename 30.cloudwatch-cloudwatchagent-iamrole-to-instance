Aws Cloudwatch:
		In AWS each service is monitored by cloudwatch for example cpu and memory of an ec2 instance.
👉️Generally  we start at "Metrics" in cliudwatch to learn.
👉️What ever the service you have used in the aws those services Metrics are available under "Metric" section in cloudwath.
👉️By default we can't monitor the "Memory" and "Disk space" of an ec2 instance with cloudwath.For that we need to install cloudwatch Agent and also we need to run perl scripts.now we can monitor the Memory and Diskspace.

  	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html
  	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/install-CloudWatch-Agent-on-EC2-Instance.html ==Installing the CloudWatch agent==

  	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file-wizard.html ==Create the CloudWatch agent configuration file with the wizard ===

Requrements:
	1. Launch one ec2 instance.
	2. create an IAM Role with permissions i)CloudWatchFullAcces and CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy
						ii)CloudWatchLogsFullAccess
						iii)AmazonSSMFullAccess
						iv)AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore	     
	   then attach this role to the ec2 instance to push metrics to the cloudWath.
	3. Create an SNS topic and subscription. when ever the cloudwatch alarm trigers the the SNS will send the notification to the members in the subscription.
	
step 1: Launch one ec2 instance
step 2: Goto IAM ->roles ->create role ->EC2 (this role is for ec2) ->permissions i)cloudwatch fullAccess	and ii)cloudwath Logs ->create role.
step3: Goto SNS ->create topic-> name:awsb24alarm ->create topic
       create subscription -> Protocal: Email -> End point: <enter the emails > ->createsubscription
     Add this subscription to the topic.
     
   when ever we congfigure the alarm  i.e,cpu >80 .the cpu usage of that instace is beyond 80% then it send a notificaiton to topic and to  subscription emails which we entered in the subscription mail.

step 4: Goto cloudwatch ->create alarm ->select metric->search for ec2 -> select instance ->Monitoring ->create alarm ->
       send a notification to : awsb24alarm  (topic name)
       Take the action: reboot the instance  (what ever the action you required)
       when ever max of cpu is >= 80 for atleast 1min ->create alarm.
       
       now you observe that in cloudwatch alarm state as "insuficient data",we need to wait some time then the state will become "ok"

now apply some stress load on the instance  to trigger the alarm

[root@ip-172-31-16-15 ~]# amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
[root@ip-172-31-16-15 ~]# sudo yum install stress -y
[root@ip-172-31-16-15 ~]# stress --cpu 8 --io 4 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 20m   (here we are givining timeout as 20 minitues)
then whenever the cpu reaches beyond the 80% automatically the cloudwatch alarm will trigger the topic and get notified to subscription.
===========
1.without installing cloudwatch agent on your ec2 instance you cant set the notification limits for MEMORY and DISK SPACE.
     i)download the cloudwacth aget
     ii)Create the CloudWatch agent configuration file with the wizard 
     iii)start the cloudwatch agent to push the metrics to clodwatch.
2. You must also make sure that the IAM role attached to the instance has the RequiredPolicys attached.

👉️now we need to run/start the cloudwatch agent:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/install-CloudWatch-Agent-commandline-fleet.html

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -s -c file:configuration-file-path

now goto cloudwatch ->metrics -> apart from AWS namespaces you observer new Custom namespaces -> under this you will find CWAgent->
 you will find the disk_used_percent and mem_used_percent options newly.
 
 there are total 4 stpes to create an alarm i)Specify metric and conditions
 					    ii)Configure actions
 					    iii)Add name and description
 					    iv)Preview and create
 Now Goto CloudWatch ->Alarms->create Alarm ->select metric ->under custom namespace select CWAgent ->select instance-id ->select metric ex:mem-used-percent-> conditions:
                         Threshold type:static
                         Whenever mem_used_percent is..: Greater  or Greater/Equal
                         than…: 50   what ever the %
                         click on next
	Configure actions:->Alarm state trigger: In alarm
			     Select an SNS topic:  select the SNS topic which you created earlier
			     EC2 action:->Alarm state trigger:In alarm
			                  Take the following action...: Reboot this instance
			                  click next
        Name and description:->Alarm name:mem-usage-alarm
                                         click on next
                                         ->create alarm
                                         
  whenever the memory usage of your instance is beyond the 50% the cloudwath will trigger the alarm then you get the notification through email and the instance will get reboot.
